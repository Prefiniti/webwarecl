<p>A Tract of Land not located within a city or county subdivision is either located within the Public Land Survey System (PLSS) or a Land Grant.  This information is usually located after the Grantor and Grantee information on your deed and will contain summarized information on your Tract of Land.  This information may be called out in various methods. The most common method is as follows:</p>

<blockquote><pre>"S17, T22S., R1W."</pre></blockquote> 

This translates as "Section 17, Township 22 South, Range 1 West."

<p><em>Note:</em><br>
A more detailed description will be required to perform your survey.  We will acquire this information by performing a title search of your property and the properties next to yours, as is required by law when performing a survey.  It is very important for you to provide us with your deed filing information if your property is not located within a city or county subdivision.</p>
