			<p><strong>Center Line Services</strong> takes its name from service itself.  We offer service to the general public, surveyors, and engineers alike.  In our hometown community of Las Cruces, New Mexico, there is a shortage in the surveying and engineering community.  We wanted to create a company that would better enable this industry to meet the demands of our developing community by offering our data services to these types of local firms.  At present we do business with several local firms for engineering survey support.</p>
			
			
			<p>To the public we offer GPS and robotic stake-out services for construction related purposes.  Our staff is highly trained in the construction industry and are always found to be very helpful and responsive on the construction site.  At this time we do business with local and out of state clients ranging from small lot layouts to large commercial projects in Ruidoso, Albuquerque and Tucson, Arizona.  We also are supported by licensed Land Surveyors in the state of New Mexico, Arizona and Colorado.  This gives us the ability to offer Mortgage Surveys, Plats of Survey, Subdivision Plats, etc...  To our clients.</p>
			
			<p>At Center Line Services we take pride in the service that we can offer you. Give us the opportunity, and we will meet the challenge and deliver in a timely, efficient manner.</p>
