We shoul be able to, upon acceptance of the job, specify whether or not it is a \"Time and Materials\" job, a \"Lump Sum\" job (which an amount would be entered by loren, or a \"Cost Estimate\" in which case an amount would be enetered and the site would notify us when we\'ve reached 3/4 of the total amount.  \"Time and Materials\" and \"Cost Estimate\" thus way all jobs would use normal task codes, but for the \"Lump Sum\" the site would know that because of the job type selection it would apply the charges as a deduction instead of a cumulative addition of task codes.\r\n2. Using the above principle, an employee doesnt build the charge for a job based on task codes, the job does based on the selection of job type then task codes, kindof a hierarchy.\r\n3. Addition of Job Expenses as a line entry in the time card.  These expenses would act just like task codes, and there is a task code for expenses, the only thing that differs is that the employee enters the amount of the expense instead of the task code entering for him/her.\r\n4. Using all this together I want the site to give me daily statistics.  ONe being a line graph of our profit charted by day/month or month/year or day/year.  The low margin being the lowest profit day and the high margin being the highest profit day.  I also want tit to tell me which employee is making the most money for me, which one is making the least, and what the average total time it takes to complete \"metes and bounds\" and \"lot and block\" surveys seperately, differentiating between Field hours and CAD/office hours.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think.\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nAG','2007-06-08 16:59:21','yes',3,0),(19,2,1,'John Esquibel Text','John F.
